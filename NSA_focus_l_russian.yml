 nasa.1.d:0 ""Savages! All of them!" The voice of Bill Nelson rang through the council room at Cape Canaveral. The room was once the meeting area for interstellar missions into the cosmos for many years, now it was a war room. The small group of men within the room were all somber as the looked toward Nelson. These men were men of intellect and genius. They had sent man into the stars through their meticulous calculations and careful planning. Not even that could prepare them for the struggle upcoming. \n\n"We cannot allow for the first opportunity America has had for technological rebirth to be ruined by the evils of mankind." Nelson continued. "We must use our superority in mind to outwit our enemies to secure a better tomorrow. Far too long have we been pressed upon the heel of bureaucracy as a pawn or toy. Today marks the beginning of real goverment; one lead by those smart enough to do so.""
