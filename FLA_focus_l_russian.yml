These were not normal people, this was the scum, the refuse, the evil. The Floridian jails had all been cleared and every single police station had been overrun and burned to the ground. All around Tex stood the future, the future of Florida, the future of America, the future of Manson's dreams. \n\n"Fellow Florida men!" Watson bellowed, "I know that I am not one of you, but we are alike in mind, alike in our spirit. We can accomplish great things together. The dream of my mentor Charles Manson will be a reality someday. I need all of you to work to stop the enemy by any means necessary. Together, as true Florida Men, we can lay waste to more than just a mere police station" \n\nA roar came from the croud as they gathered around Watson ready to hear what his plans were."

 fla.2.d:0 "Miami was burning rubble. Smoke hung to every square foot. Buildings stood in ruin as citizens fled in the face of the most evil army ever to step foot in America. The Florida Anarchist army was an organized group of savage and insane criminals, sweeping through Florida like the Barbarians pushing their way into the Roman Empire. In their wake, death, famine and destruction were rampant. This army of evil now gathered in the Miami Government buidling to witness the birth of a new era. \n\nTex Watson stood on top of a balcony, silver baseball bat in hand. At his feet was Francis X. Suarez, naked and handcuffed. Watson looked over the crowd of his loyal followers then he looked towards the ground. "Charles" he said softly. "Your plans are coming to fruition. Soon the world will know humanity's true nature. Soon they will see we are all animals." \n\nWatson then turned his gaze to his soldiers. He slowly raised his bat over his head with both hands. His men began to yell, shout and holler like caged animals. Suarez looked towards Watson with a fleeting look of hope in his eyes. Watson would show no hope. He began to beat Suarez into a paste on the ground with the bat. Strike after strike cracked bones, cut tissue and opened wounds. After 15 minutes, Suarez could hardley be recognized. Watson then began to slowly cut off Suarez's head with a small knife. Blood splattered over his face as he went. Watson merely licked it from his lips. With a thundering yell of "Anarchy!" he hoisted the severed head of Suarez into the air. His men roared and even began to hit one another. This was truly madness in its most raw form..."
