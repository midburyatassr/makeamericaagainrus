Now, upon the brink of annihilation, Miami was a loosely strung together goverment lead by the former moderatre Republican Francis X. Suarez. Suarez was no military mastermind but he knew how to speak to the masses. Soon his voice was playing over every single radio and TV in the area. \n\n"My fellow Floridians. We must during this trying time come together as one. The forces of evil and destruction lie at our gates and if we continue to fight, we will become only a distant memory in the pages of history. I need you all to fight for your civil liberities and freedoms you hold so dear, for the battle upcoming depends on it.
